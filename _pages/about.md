Bio
------
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, with [Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/). Before moving to Sweden, I received my Ph.D. from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Yiguang Hong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QUTN3IwAAAAJ). I got my B.Sc. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Anhui, China, in 2017. 

Research Interests
------
- Networked/ multiplayer game theory, with both theoretical analysis and algorithm design
- Distributed optimization/ learning, especially with constraint or uncertainty
- Stability, robustness, cognition, and initiative in CPS/ cybersecurity
